      <h5>Archangels Poem:</h5>

      <p><b>Angels and "You":</b></p>

      <p>We often think of angels
      like figurines in the Christmas tree,
      that dangle sweetly from twigs,
      or false beings in a dream.
      "Angels are around you"</p>

      <p>They are also His helpers of light,
      they hear the sincere prayers,
      which we have addressed to him,
      and will arrive in no time.
      "Angels will be strong for you"<p>

      <p>They help with light energy,
      decorated in brilliant colours.
      Working flawlessly in harmony,
      let them work miracles.
      "Angels will survive for you"<p>

      <p>Each angel has its color :
      white for the angels of peace,
      soft pink, the favorite color
      of all His angels of love.
      "Angels will protect you"<p>

      <p>Blue is a protective shade,
      green for angels who heal,
      those of wisdom are tinged with gold,
      color rules the angelic being.
      "Angels will be there in time of need for you"</p>

      <p>Flaming candles in colors
      especially attract angels.
      Atmospheric in delicious scents,
      so no angel ever fails.
      "Angels will never leave you"<p>
